## Git Setup and Basics

### About Git and GitHub

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a popular version control system that is the foundation of most open source software development. You are not required to be a Git pro in advance of this event, but come prepared to learn a lot about it! [GitHub](https://github.com) is a hosting service for Git repositories, enabling us to share code across teams in a web environment.

We will use Git and GitHub for collaborative work.

### Git Installation

* Windows
    * Install Git for Windows from this [link](https://gitforwindows.org/). For more setup details follow these [instructions](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#shell)
* Mac OS
    * Download the [git installer](https://git-scm.com/download/mac) and run it. 
* Linux (Debian/Ubuntu): `sudo apt install git-all`

To test, open the terminal (on Windows, Git Bash) and setup your username and email:

```bash
git config --global user.name "your username"
git config --global user.email "your email"
```


### Getting started with Bash terminal

During the CANARI-Sprint week it will be useful to know how to navigate between files from the command line. If you are not familiar with the linux shell commands, you can review the first three sections of this [Software Carpentry Shell Novice](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) lesson. On Windows, use the Git Bash terminal to run these commands.

### Terminal (command line) text editor

When working on the command line (the terminal or shell), it is often handy to modify file content directly from there. For that you can use a command line editor such as [nano](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-nano-text-editor/). On Mac and Linux it is usually pre-installed, and on Windows it is installed when you install Git (see [here](http://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#editor) for more information about nano and its configuration). Test your installation by opening a terminal and running `nano --version`. If it works you can link your git configuration with `nano`:

```bash
git config --global core.editor "nano -w"
```

### Git steps and workflows

#### 1. Create a project repository

On your own or someone in your project group (preferably one who has done it before), create a repository for the project under the `CANARI-sprint` organization, `https://github.com/CANARI-sprint`

![New Repo](assets/newRepo.png)

Click `New` and follow the steps: check yes to create a `README.md` file.

* Format project name as `proj-myprojectname` (you can change the name later), where `myprojectname` is a brief name for your project
* Invite others to the repo:
    * `Settings -> Collaborators`
    * Note to collaborators: you will receive an invitation to your email associated with github.com. If you cannnot find it look for the `bell` notifications on the top right of the website.

#### 2. Clone the repository

Each participant should clone the repository so they have their copy on their JupyterHub account space (and locally in the participant's computer, if desired). Navigate through the terminal to the folder where you want to keep CANARI-Sprint work (`cd path_to_canari-sprint-work`).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CANARI-Sprint/proj-myprojectname.git
```

This will create a new folder called `proj-myprojectname`. Navigate (`cd`) to this new folder.

#### 3. Update the README with your name

Open the `README.md` file with your favorite editor and create a new section header. Under this section add your name. Then add this change, commit it to the local repository, and push it so that it appears on the `origin` GitHub repository.

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Adding new name to README.md"
git push origin
```

Make sure your change appears online.

*Remember to run* `git status` to observe the changes made into your repository. Pay attention to the colors. To see the changes in the files run `git diff`.

#### 4. Update your local repository (local clone) with the changes of your collaborators

```bash
git pull origin main
```

`Short names for repositories:`: Remember `origin` is just a short name of the web address of the repository.
To see what is hidden in origin: `git remote -v`

To continue practicing these steps, make more changes to the title and the description of the project.

*Ran into a problem?* `!ATTENTION`

When working with several people sometimes you

* Cannot push because changes have been made that have not been incorporated: need to first pull
* When pulling you arrive into a merge conflict: need to resolve the conflict manually
```

#### 5. Resolving the merge conflict

```bash
git status
```

You will see the file(s) which caused the merge conflict in green.

Open it and detect the conflict by the special format:

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
my text
=======
somebody else's text
>>>>>>> 35ab35436
```

Decide which changes you want to keep, and modify the file so it looks as you wish directly from the editor. Remove the unnecessary characters. Add, commit and push the changes.

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "resolving merge conflict"
git push origin main
```

You can continue working on as usual.

*Remember to pull often and push small changes* 
... to avoid messing with complicated merges and keep your repo up-to-date.

### Troubleshooting

#### Deleting files

```bash
git rm filename.txt
rm filename.txt
```

`Note`: `git rm` just removes the file from git, to delete the file completely use the bash `rm` command after that.

#### Reverting to the previous commit

```bash
git revert HEAD
```
	
`Note`: Your files in the local repo will still be there.
