# About 

As part of the [CANARI project](https://canari.ac.uk/) (Climate change in the Arctic – North Atlantic region and impacts on the UK) a large ensemble of the HadGEM3 coupled climate model is being run, [CANARI-LE](https://canari.ac.uk/resources_new/tools/).  A data analysis sprint is planned for the week of March 4-8, 2024 to get a jump start on the analysis of the data being generated.  This page is designed to provide details of the ensemble, information about the [data and how to access](data.md), [pre-event requirements](setup.md), [sprint](sprint.md), [tutorials](tutorials.md) and [frequently asked questions](FAQ.md).  

## Highlights

**Day 3**

First results from Kamil, Claire and Owen, investigating sea surface temperature in cold air outbreak regions.

More AMOC plots from Niamh, this time in depth space at 40N.

Here are some Adam's plots of annual mean AMOC index at 26N and 1 km depth.

Now available, thanks to Adam, AMOC in depth and density space (/gws/nopw/j04/canari/shared/large-ensemble/derived/HIST2/_ensemble num_/OCN/yearly/_year_/).

First results from Lizzie, composite of DJF sea level pressure for strong - weak polar vortex.

**Day 2**

First results from Bablu, the surface ocean heat flux in the sub-polar gyre for all ensemble members.

First results from Tony who is looking sudden stratospheric warming, the figure takes a look at the annual cycle of 10hPa U in ensemble member 1.  Years with suspected SSW are highlighted in colour, others are in grey.

**Day 1**

First results from Dan, the mean sub-polar gyre (50:65N, 0:60W) SST and upper 500 m potential temperature.  With shading showing +/- 1 standard deviation.
