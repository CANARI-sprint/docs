# About 

As part of the [CANARI](https://ncas.ac.uk/our-science/long-term-collaborations/canari/) (Climate change in the Arctic – North Atlantic region and impacts on the UK) project a large ensemble of the HadGEM3 coupled climate model is being run.  This page is designed to provide details of the ensemble (below), information about the [data](data.md) and how to access, any events (e.g. [March 2024 Sprint](sprint.md)), [highlights](highlights.md) and [frequently asked questions](FAQ.md).  

## Ensemble Details 

Need to verify/look up these details and add references

Model: HadGEM3-GC1.3-MM, same configuration as used in CMIP6, global configuration version 3.1

Ocean: NEMO3.6

Atmosphere: UM

Sea Ice: CICE

Land: Jules

40 historical (1950-2014) ensemble members

40 future projection, SSP3-7.0 (2015-2100) ensemble members 

## State of Ensemble

Currently running historical simulations, with approximately 25 ensemble members complete and 15 running.  Detailed information on the state of the ensemble can be found [here](https://gws-access.jasmin.ac.uk/public/canari/production/canari-le-production-status.html).

An example set of data is currently uploaded onto and priority variables are in process of being downloaded from tape to JASMIN.

## How to cite

There is no specific paper yet on the large ensemble, so please reference the HadGEM3.1 paper and acknowledge CANARI and JASMIN.

## Publications

Soon :)
