# About 

As part of the [CANARI project](https://canari.ac.uk/) (Climate change in the Arctic – North Atlantic region and impacts on the UK) project a large ensemble of the HadGEM3 coupled climate model is being run, [CANARI-LE](https://canari.ac.uk/resources_new/tools/).  A data analysis sprint is planned for the week of March 4-8, 2024 to get a jump start on the analysis of the data being generated.  This page is designed to provide details of the ensemble, information about the [data and how to access](data.md), [pre-event requirements](setup.md), [sprint](sprint.md), [tutorials](tutorials.md) and [frequently asked questions](FAQ.md).
