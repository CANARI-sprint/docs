# About 

As part of the [CANARI project](https://canari.ac.uk/) (Climate change in the Arctic – North Atlantic region and impacts on the UK) a large ensemble of the HadGEM3 coupled climate model is being run, [CANARI-LE](https://canari.ac.uk/resources_new/tools/).  A data analysis sprint is planned for the week of March 4-8, 2024 to get a jump start on the analysis of the data being generated.  This page is designed to provide details of the ensemble, information about the [data and how to access](data.md), [pre-event requirements](setup.md), [sprint](sprint.md), [tutorials](tutorials.md) and [frequently asked questions](FAQ.md).  

## Highlights

**Day 3**

First results from Lizzie, composite of DJF sea level pressure for strong - weak polar vortex.

**Day 2**

First results from Bablu, the surface ocean heat flux in the sub-polar gyre for all ensemble members.

First results from Tony who is looking sudden stratospheric warming, the figure takes a look at the annual cycle of 10hPa U in ensemble member 1.  Years with suspected SSW are highlighted in colour, others are in grey.

**Day 1**

First results from Dan, the mean sub-polar gyre (50:65N, 0:60W) SST and upper 500 m potential temperature.  With shading showing +/- 1 standard deviation.
