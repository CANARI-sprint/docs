# About 

As part of the [CANARI project](https://canari.ac.uk/) (Climate change in the Arctic – North Atlantic region and impacts on the UK) a large ensemble of the HadGEM3 coupled climate model is being run, [CANARI-LE](https://canari.ac.uk/resources_new/tools/).  Following the success of the data analysis sprint in March 2024 a data has been set for a second sprint, the week of January 27-31, 2025.  This page is designed to provide details of the ensemble, information about the [data and how to access it](data.md), [pre-event requirements](setup.md), [sprint](sprint.md), [tutorials](tutorials.md) and [frequently asked questions](FAQ.md).  Highlights from the previous can current sprints can be found on the [highlights](highlights.md) page.
