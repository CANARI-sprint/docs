# Data 

The CANARI-LE is currently being run on ARCHER2 with data being stored on tape on JASMIN with some data being stored in the CANARI group workspace (gws).

## Ensemble Details 

Model: HadGEM3-GC1.3-MM, same configuration as used in CMIP6, global configuration version 3.1

Ocean: NEMO3.6

Atmosphere: UM

Sea Ice: CICE

Land: Jules

40 historical (1950-2014) ensemble members

40 future projection, SSP3-7.0 (2015-2100) ensemble members 

More information on the CANARI-LE can be found [here](https://ncas-cms.github.io/canari/).

## State of Ensemble

Currently running historical simulations, with 27 ensemble members completed and 13 running.  Detailed information on the state of the ensemble can be found [here](https://gws-access.jasmin.ac.uk/public/canari/production/canari-le-production-status.html).

## Data Access

To access the CANARI-LE data available on JASMIN you need to apply for access to the CANARI gws through the [JASMIN accounts portal](https://accounts.jasmin.ac.uk/) under the my services button.

An example set of data is currently uploaded onto the CANARI gws (/gws/nopw/j04/canari/users/reinhard/data/u-cy573-sample) and priority variables are in process of being downloaded from tape to JASMIN (/gws/nopw/j04/canari/shared/large-ensemble/priority/HIST2).

The list of priority variables are on these [spreadsheets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12CXfpZdFQDTLTi57ROw3VucY_-nozm-b).

## Useful Files

For the ocean the mesh_mask and subbasins files can be found in the CANARI gws here /gws/nopw/j04/canari/shared/large-ensemble/ocean
